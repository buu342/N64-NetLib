# Example Servers

This folder contains a list of example games, showing how to use the NetLib stack. The client ROMs were all written in Libultra, with Libdragon ports planned for the future. The servers were all written in Java using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org).

### Credits

* The servers use [WaifUPnP](https://github.com/adolfintel/WaifUPnP) for UPnP
